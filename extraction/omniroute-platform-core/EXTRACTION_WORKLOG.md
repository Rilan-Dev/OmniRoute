## Completion 024 — expose concrete supplemental blocker samples

### Planned
Continue from Completion 023 by exposing representative blocker records from the remote supplemental analyzer. The observed blocker summary is 79 dynamic-import and 12 dynamic-require records; before changing classification or fail-closed behavior, inspect the concrete expressions and files that produce them.

### Completed
- Observed Actions run `36683903864`, job `109785258776`, for commit `374b4dd070cfad335117f424c14f9906c681d383`.
- Exact pinned source worktree again passed at commit `453918ab64f147604576e72d33e2bbfc12b2d1af` and tree `76f3546d48a7293b199b7571d13808bebadb6d1f`.
- Primary closure scanner is machine-clean: 12,562 files walked, 5,902 source files, 22,320 import edges, 0 genuine unresolved imports, 4 generated-runtime references.
- Supplemental blocker summary is exactly 79 dynamic-import and 12 dynamic-require blockers; no invalid package, workspace package, or database-migration blocker was observed in this run.
- Updated the supplemental analyzer to emit the first 25 concrete blocker records in the console, while retaining the complete blocker records in the JSON report and preserving fail-closed exit behavior.
- No pinned OmniRoute source files were modified.

### Not done
- The concrete dynamic import/require blocker sample has not yet executed remotely.
- No dynamic-loader blocker has been reclassified or suppressed.
- Closure mapper, Phase 7 second-pass, combined Phase 1 gate, Phase 7 reconciliation, immutable source copy, and extraction-integrity verification remain blocked.

### Gate
Completion 024: blocker composition is proven; concrete dynamic-loader evidence instrumentation is prepared. Phase 1 PASS OPEN. Phase 2 BLOCKED.

### Next-work prompt
Continue from Completion 024. Observe the Actions run from this commit and inspect the concrete blocker sample. Determine whether each dynamic import/require is statically bounded by repository source, a plugin/provider registry, a documented runtime discovery mechanism, or an external/runtime dependency. Only replace a fail-closed blocker with explicit closure evidence when the source proves the bounded set; otherwise add a dependency-closure inventory requirement rather than suppressing it. Then rerun all collectors, execute the combined Phase 1 gate, reconcile every Phase 7 candidate, and only after genuine machine-complete PASS begin immutable source copying and Git-tree integrity verification.


## Completion 025 — make supplemental dynamic-loader detection code-aware

### Planned
Inspect the concrete blocker sample from run 36685402143 and correct only proven analyzer false positives before attempting any blocker classification.

### Completed
- Remote sample proved the blocker set was 79 dynamic imports and 12 dynamic requires.
- A concrete false-positive mechanism was identified: the supplemental analyzer used raw regular expressions over full source text, so documented examples such as a comment mentioning a require() could become blockers. The update.mjs sample demonstrates this risk.
- Another correctness issue was identified: the previous ([^)]*) expression truncated nested calls such as pathToFileURL(path.join(...)), preventing accurate classification of the runtime expression.
- Replaced only the verifier's dynamic-loader collector with a code-aware scanner that skips comments and quoted strings and balances nested parentheses.
- Literal dynamic imports remain non-blocking; non-literal runtime loaders remain fail-closed until their closure is proven.
- No pinned OmniRoute source files were modified.
- Tooling commit: 9c86cf531b7f2efdeae0b6047083c70a9de8a3f9.

### Not done
- The corrected scanner has not yet executed remotely.
- No dynamic loader has been suppressed merely because it looks likely to be bounded.
- Phase 1 combined gate, Phase 7 reconciliation, immutable source copy, and Git-tree integrity verification remain blocked.

### Gate
Completion 025: verifier false-positive/truncation correction committed. Phase 1 PASS OPEN.

### Next-work prompt
Observe the Actions run from 9c86cf531b7f2efdeae0b6047083c70a9de8a3f9. Inspect the new blocker count/sample. If only genuinely dynamic loaders remain, classify them by proven closure: repository-bounded runtime path, registry/plugin discovery, optional native dependency, or externally supplied module. Add explicit evidence fields rather than broad suppression. Continue until the supplemental collector is genuinely clean, then run closure mapper, Phase 7 second pass, combined gate, reconciliation, immutable copy, and exact Git-tree integrity verification.
## Completion 026 — preserve source offsets in dynamic-loader scanner

### Planned
Continue from Completion 025 by executing the corrected supplemental scanner remotely. Before classifying any remaining dynamic loader, fix the newly observed extraction bug if the code-aware mask changes source offsets.

### Completed
- Observed Actions run `36691253038` for the prior Completion 025 worklog commit.
- Primary closure scanner remained machine-clean: 12,562 files walked, 5,902 source files, 22,320 import edges, 0 genuine unresolved imports, 4 generated-runtime references.
- The new supplemental output exposed a verifier defect: masking comments and quoted strings with a single space destroyed source offsets, so the scanner sliced the original source at incorrect positions and produced character-level/garbled dynamic-import details.
- Updated only the verifier to replace each masked non-newline character with a space, preserving exact source offsets while still removing comments and quoted strings from executable-code detection.
- Tooling commit: 869ca9ce20506673c0074f7aef0d40806f2703b1.
- No pinned OmniRoute source files were modified.

### Not done
- The offset-preserving scanner has not yet executed remotely.
- Dynamic-loader closure classification is still intentionally fail-closed.
- Combined Phase 1 gate, Phase 7 reconciliation, immutable source copy, and Git-tree integrity verification remain blocked.

### Gate
Completion 026: dynamic-loader scanner offset correctness fixed. Phase 1 PASS OPEN.

### Next-work prompt
Observe the Actions run from 869ca9ce20506673c0074f7aef0d40806f2703b1. Inspect the complete blocker summary/sample. If blockers remain, classify the actual expressions and call sites from the pinned source without broad suppression. If the supplemental collector becomes clean, immediately inspect closure-mapper and Phase 7 outputs, then run the combined gate/reconciliation and proceed to immutable source copying only after all gates genuinely PASS.
