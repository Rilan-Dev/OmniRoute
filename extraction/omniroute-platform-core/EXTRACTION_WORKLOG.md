## Completion 024 — expose concrete supplemental blocker samples

### Planned
Continue from Completion 023 by exposing representative blocker records from the remote supplemental analyzer. The observed blocker summary is 79 dynamic-import and 12 dynamic-require records; before changing classification or fail-closed behavior, inspect the concrete expressions and files that produce them.

### Completed
- Observed Actions run `36683903864`, job `109785258776`, for commit `374b4dd070cfad335117f424c14f9906c681d383`.
- Exact pinned source worktree again passed at commit `453918ab64f147604576e72d33e2bbfc12b2d1af` and tree `76f3546d48a7293b199b7571d13808bebadb6d1f`.
- Primary closure scanner is machine-clean: 12,562 files walked, 5,902 source files, 22,320 import edges, 0 genuine unresolved imports, 4 generated-runtime references.
- Supplemental blocker summary is exactly 79 dynamic-import and 12 dynamic-require blockers; no invalid package, workspace package, or database-migration blocker was observed in this run.
- Updated the supplemental analyzer to emit the first 25 concrete blocker records in the console, while retaining the complete blocker records in the JSON report and preserving fail-closed exit behavior.
- No pinned OmniRoute source files were modified.

### Not done
- The concrete dynamic import/require blocker sample has not yet executed remotely.
- No dynamic-loader blocker has been reclassified or suppressed.
- Closure mapper, Phase 7 second-pass, combined Phase 1 gate, Phase 7 reconciliation, immutable source copy, and extraction-integrity verification remain blocked.

### Gate
Completion 024: blocker composition is proven; concrete dynamic-loader evidence instrumentation is prepared. Phase 1 PASS OPEN. Phase 2 BLOCKED.

### Next-work prompt
Continue from Completion 024. Observe the Actions run from this commit and inspect the concrete blocker sample. Determine whether each dynamic import/require is statically bounded by repository source, a plugin/provider registry, a documented runtime discovery mechanism, or an external/runtime dependency. Only replace a fail-closed blocker with explicit closure evidence when the source proves the bounded set; otherwise add a dependency-closure inventory requirement rather than suppressing it. Then rerun all collectors, execute the combined Phase 1 gate, reconcile every Phase 7 candidate, and only after genuine machine-complete PASS begin immutable source copying and Git-tree integrity verification.
